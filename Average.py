# There are five trees in Jack's front yard. He checks each tree to find out how tall it is in inches and writes the height on a sheet of paper. Jack's list: 98, 94, 41, 96, and 11. What is the average height of a tree in Jack's front yard?
tree1 = 98
tree2 = 94
tree3 = 41
tree4 = 96
tree5 = 11
tree6 = 24
# we will be calculating the average number with these numbers, average = added every height divided by total number of the trees
sumheight = tree1 + tree2 + tree3 + tree4 + tree5 + tree6
average = sumheight//6
print("average height of tree is",average)
